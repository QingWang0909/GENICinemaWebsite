  GENI Cinema Setup/Installation Instructions

    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
    GENI Cinema uses the open source and community-developed Video LAN Client (VLC) media player plugin 
to display live video streams in your browser (i.e. the "VLC Plugin"). 
The VLC Plugin is similar to Silverlight, Flash, and other browser plugins – 
it is used to display multimedia content within a webpage. 
The following will guide you installing the VLC Plugin in order 
for you to enjoy the GENI Cinema experience.
   </p>

    <p><h2>Windows 7 VLC Plugin Installation</h2>
    GENI Cinema has been tested and is compatible with Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox in Windows 7. Please acquire an up-to-date copy of one of these browsers before proceeding with the VLC Plugin installation or using GENI Cinema. Other browsers and Windows versions might be supported but have not been verified individually.</p>


    <p>1) Navigate to the VLC webpage:<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc">Go get VLC!</a></p>

    <p>2) Download VLC version 2.2.0 for Windows</p>

    <p>3) If the installer does not automatically start after the download completes, browse to your download location and run the installer manually by double-clicking it.</p>

    <p>6) Continue with Using GENI Cinema below.</p>

    <p><h2>Mac OS X 10.6 and greater VLC Plugin Installation</h2>

    <p>GENI Cinema is compatible with Safari, Chrome, and Firefox in Mac OS X Yosemite. Other OS X versions after 10.6 should also be compatible; however, they have not been verified individually. Please acquire an up-to-date copy of OS X and one of these browsers before proceeding with the VLC Plugin installation or using GENI Cinema.</p>

    <p>1) Download the following VLC Plugin installer:<a href="http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/macosx-intel/VLC-webplugin-20150302-0554.dmg">Get VLC plugin!</a></p>

    <p>2) If the installer does not automatically start after the download completes, browse to your download location and run the installer by double-clicking it.</p>

    <p>3) In the VLC Browser Plug-in for Mac window that appears, drag the VLC Plugin.plugin file to the Internet Plug-Ins folder indicated in the installer window. Depending on your security preferences, you might be prompted for your Mac OS X account password. The plugin will then be copied to Internet Plug-Ins, after which point installation will be complete.</p>

    <p>4) Continue with Using GENI Cinema below.</p>

    <p><h2>Using GENI Cinema</h2></p>

    <p>1) If your web browser has not been restarted since you installed the VLC Plugin, please restart it by closing the browser and then opening it once again. (Please make sure all browser windows and tabs are closed in this process.) If your web browser was not open to begin with, simply start it.</p>

   <p>2) Navigate to the following website:<a href="http://cinema.smartfuture2015.net/">GENI Cinema</a></p>

   <p>3) Create a free GENI Cinema account if you do not have one already by clicking the Sign Up button. Fill out the required information and click Submit to proceed.</p>

   <p>4) Login with your GENI Cinema account by providing your username, password, and then by clicking the Login button. You will be directed to a new page.</p>

   <p>5) Click the Live Video Stream Guide button. You will be directed to a live of available live video streams or "channels".</p>

   <p>6) Peruse the available channels and pick out one of interest to you. Note that for GEC22, no videos are password-protected, so simply leave the password field blank once you have decided on a video.</p>

   <p>7) Click the Watch Channel button underneath the channel of interest. You will be taken to the Live Video Stream Theater.</p>

   <p>8) If this is the first time watching a live video stream with GENI Cinema, you will likely be prompted to give permission for the VLC Plugin to run in the webpage (as per your security policy). </br> Grant permission one of two ways: </br>    (a) enable the plugin in the center of the page by clicking the empty plugin, or </br>    (b) enable the plugin by clicking the popup that appears in the browser URL field.</p>

   <p>9) Your live stream should start momentarily. If it does not, refresh the webpage to restart with the newly-enabled VLC Plugin.</p>

   <p>10) You can double-click the video in the player to go full-screen; if in full-screen mode, double-click the video in the full-screen player to restore a full-screen window back into the player.</p>

   <p>11) On the right side of the screen, you will see a list of available channels. Click Refresh List to update the list. Pick out another channel of interest. For GEC22, ignore the password field, as all video streams will be pre-configured with a blank/empty password. Then, underneath your video of choice, click Switch to Channel X, where X is the channel number you would like to watch.</p>

   <p>12) Shortly after clicking Switch to Channel X, your video stream will update in the video player. Unlike current live video streaming technologies, your video stream is being switched in the cloud, which allows you as the viewer to stay on the same webpage and not initiate another stream/connection to your browser. Consequently, GENI Cinema utilizes bandwidth efficiently in order to provide a live television-like service over the Internet – powered by GENI and software defined networking/OpenFlow. Pretty cool, right?!</p>
